      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Malabar Civet (<em>Viverra civettina</em>), also known as the Malabar Large-spotted Civet, is one of the rarest and most elusive mammals native to India. Endemic to the Western Ghats, particularly in the state of Kerala, this nocturnal animal is critically endangered and possibly extinct, with very few confirmed sightings in recent decades. This mysterious creature is a medium-sized carnivore, characterized by its elongated body, spotted fur, long bushy tail, and distinctive facial mask.
        <br><br>
        Historically, the Malabar Civet was commonly found in the lowland evergreen forests and riparian habitats of the Western Ghats. However, due to massive deforestation, urbanization, and habitat destruction, their population plummeted drastically. Conservationists and wildlife researchers continue efforts to locate and protect the remaining population, if any. The Malabar Civet symbolizes the urgent need for habitat conservation and highlights the fragility of India's endemic fauna.

    <!-- Classification and Habitat -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">Classification and Habitat</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Indian Malabar Civet belongs to the Viverridae family and is scientifically categorized as follows:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> Animalia</li>
          <li><strong>Phylum:</strong> Chordata</li>
          <li><strong>Class:</strong> Mammalia</li>
          <li><strong>Order:</strong> Carnivora</li>
          <li><strong>Family:</strong> Viverridae</li>
          <li><strong>Genus:</strong> Viverra</li>
          <li><strong>Species:</strong> V. civettina</li>
        </ul>
        The Malabar Civet was once widespread in the coastal and inland evergreen forests of Kerala and parts of Karnataka. It thrived in low elevation areas rich in water sources and dense vegetation. Today, its preferred habitat has been overtaken by human settlements, plantations, and commercial development. The species is now possibly restricted to small, inaccessible forest patches, if it still survives. Their secretive and solitary behavior adds to the difficulty in confirming their current status, although a few local reports occasionally spark hope for their existence.

    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">About the Indian Malabar Civet</h2>
      <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">

          <img src="./images/species/malabar-civet.jpg"

            The Malabar Civet is a sleek, agile carnivore with greyish or brownish fur, prominent black spots along its body, and black-and-white facial markings. It typically measures around 2.5 to 3.5 feet in length, including its tail. Primarily nocturnal and solitary, this civet is rarely observed during the daytime. It uses scent glands to mark its territory and communicates through low grunts and growls. Its diet includes rodents, birds, insects, and occasionally fruits.
            <br><br>
            What makes the Indian Malabar Civet stand out is not just its rarity but the fact that it may be functionally extinct in the wild. The last confirmed sighting was several decades ago, although there have been sporadic, unconfirmed reports since. The civet's survival depends entirely on swift conservation action, focused habitat protection, and targeted surveys to rediscover and conserve any remaining individuals. Its mysterious status makes it a subject of great interest among zoologists and conservationists.

    <!-- State-wise Presence in India -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">Presence in India</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Malabar Civet is historically endemic to the **Western Ghats**, particularly the **Malabar coast** in **Kerala**. Over time, deforestation and land-use change drastically shrunk its habitat. The last confirmed populations were found in:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Kerala:</strong> Kozhikode, Kannur, and nearby coastal districts</li>
          <li><strong>Karnataka:</strong> Potential historic sightings from Coorg forests</li>
        </ul>
        However, the species is now listed as “Critically Endangered (Possibly Extinct)” by the IUCN. The major issue is the **absence of verifiable field evidence** for decades. Some camera traps have been set up in forest regions in Kerala, but no confirmed footage has been recovered. Scientists urge for urgent research-backed surveys and community engagement to possibly locate the last survivors of this species and protect them from further extinction.

    <!-- Threats and Conservation -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">Threats and Conservation</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The primary threat to the Malabar Civet is **habitat destruction**, especially due to encroachment by **plantations**, **urbanization**, and **infrastructure development** in the Western Ghats. It is believed that this species cannot survive in fragmented or altered landscapes. Other potential threats include poaching, road kills, and lack of awareness about the species among local communities.
        <br><br>
        Conservation steps recommended include:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li>Immediate and large-scale field surveys using camera traps and DNA-based sampling</li>
          <li>Strict enforcement of environmental laws in the Western Ghats</li>
          <li>Community-based forest protection initiatives</li>
          <li>Awareness programs to involve local people in reporting sightings</li>
          <li>Reforestation of key areas where they were historically seen</li>
        </ul>
        The Malabar Civet's story is a warning about how silently species can disappear without notice. Government agencies, NGOs, and citizen scientists must collaborate quickly to act before it becomes completely lost forever.

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Indian Malabar Civet represents a living mystery, a symbol of what is at stake in the battle to preserve India’s biodiversity. Its possible extinction is a reminder that conservation is not just about large, well-known animals like tigers and elephants, but also about smaller, lesser-known creatures that play vital roles in the ecosystem. The time to act is now—through science, policy, and people—to uncover the truth about this elusive animal and give it a fighting chance at survival. Let us not allow the Malabar Civet to vanish without a trace.
