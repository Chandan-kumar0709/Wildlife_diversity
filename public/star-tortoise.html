      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Indian Star Tortoise (<em>Geochelone elegans</em>) is one of the most beautiful tortoise species in the world. Named after the unique star-like radiating patterns on its domed shell, it is native to dry areas and scrub forests of India and parts of Sri Lanka and Pakistan.
        <br><br>
        This tortoise is well-adapted to dry environments and is primarily herbivorous, feeding on grasses, fruits, and flowers. Despite its hardy appearance, it is a slow-moving, shy creature that depends heavily on its camouflage for protection from predators.

    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-800 mb-4">Classification and Habitat</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Scientifically classified as follows:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> Animalia</li>
          <li><strong>Phylum:</strong> Chordata</li>
          <li><strong>Class:</strong> Reptilia</li>
          <li><strong>Order:</strong> Testudines</li>
          <li><strong>Family:</strong> Testudinidae</li>
          <li><strong>Genus:</strong> Geochelone</li>
          <li><strong>Species:</strong> G. elegans</li>
        </ul>
        The Indian Star Tortoise is usually found in dry grasslands, thorn forests, and scrublands. It thrives in arid zones of the Indian subcontinent, especially in regions where the temperature varies dramatically during day and night.

            The Indian Star Tortoise is best known for its spectacular star-patterned shell, which helps it blend into dry leaf litter and desert scrub. This natural camouflage plays a critical role in avoiding detection by predators.
            <br><br>
            These tortoises are diurnal and are most active during early morning or late evening. They tend to avoid extreme temperatures by burrowing under shrubs or rocks during the midday heat.
            <br><br>
            They have a gentle disposition and are considered sacred in some Indian cultures. Unfortunately, this reverence has also made them vulnerable to illegal pet trade.

    <!-- State-wise Presence in India -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-800 mb-4">Presence in India</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In India, the Indian Star Tortoise is primarily found in:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li>Rajasthan</li>
          <li>Madhya Pradesh</li>
          <li>Tamil Nadu</li>
          <li>Andhra Pradesh</li>
          <li>Gujarat</li>
        </ul>
        Their distribution is patchy, and they are most frequently spotted in dry deciduous forests and semi-arid plains. The population density is relatively low, making them harder to study and monitor in the wild.

    <!-- Threats and Conservation -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-800 mb-4">Threats and Conservation</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Despite being protected under Schedule IV of the Indian Wildlife Protection Act, the Indian Star Tortoise faces numerous threats:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li>Illegal pet trade and smuggling</li>
          <li>Habitat destruction due to urbanization and agriculture</li>
          <li>Road kills and fire accidents in scrub forests</li>
          <li>Invasive plant species reducing native vegetation</li>
        </ul>
        Conservation strategies involve:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li>Strict enforcement of anti-poaching laws</li>
          <li>Awareness campaigns in local communities</li>
          <li>Rescue and rehabilitation of seized tortoises</li>
          <li>Collaboration with international wildlife trade monitoring networks</li>
        </ul>

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-800 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Indian Star Tortoise is a fragile jewel of the dry forests of India. With its unique appearance and ecological role, it deserves comprehensive protection and respect. By controlling illegal trade, restoring habitats, and engaging local communities, we can ensure a future where this star-patterned reptile continues to grace our ecosystems for generations to come.
