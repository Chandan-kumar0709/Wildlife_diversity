      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The peacock, known for its breathtaking beauty and grandeur, is one of the most visually captivating birds in the world. Revered in art, mythology, and religious texts, this magnificent bird is deeply embedded in Indian culture and identity. The Indian Peacock, or Indian Peafowl (*Pavo cristatus*), is not only the national bird of India but also a symbol of elegance, pride, and immortality. With its iridescent plumage, mesmerizing courtship dance, and loud calls, the peacock is a prominent figure in forests, temples, and even villages across India. This page explores the various species of peacocks around the world while shining a spotlight on the Indian Peacock—its biology, distribution, ecological significance, and efforts to protect it.

    <!-- Types of Peacocks -->

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-4">Types of Peacocks</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        There are three primary species of peafowl known to science:
        <strong>Indian Peafowl (Pavo cristatus)</strong>, <strong>Green Peafowl (Pavo muticus)</strong>, and <strong>Congo Peafowl (Afropavo congensis)</strong>. The Indian Peafowl is native to the Indian subcontinent and is the most widely recognized species, thanks to its brilliant blue neck and extravagant tail feathers. The Green Peafowl, native to Southeast Asia, has a more uniform green sheen and is more endangered due to habitat loss. The Congo Peafowl, found in central Africa, is the most elusive and displays more subdued coloring. Each species has adapted uniquely to its habitat, but all share similar mating displays, dietary habits, and territorial behavior. While their plumage attracts admiration, it also serves vital biological purposes like mating selection and territorial defense.

            The Indian Peacock is perhaps the most iconic bird species in the subcontinent. Known for its dazzling train of feathers, shimmering blue-green neck, and vibrant eye patterns, the male peacock is truly a spectacle. Females, called peahens, are less colorful but play an equally important role in nurturing their young. Males use their vibrant plumage and elaborate dances to attract mates during the breeding season, which typically coincides with the monsoon. These displays are not only visual but also involve loud, echoing calls that can travel for miles in forested landscapes.

        The Indian Peacock is primarily a ground-dwelling bird that roosts in trees at night. It is omnivorous, feeding on insects, grains, seeds, small reptiles, and even snakes. This diet makes it beneficial to agriculture, as it helps control pest populations. Despite its grand appearance, the bird is shy and alert in the wild. It is also incredibly adaptive, thriving in forests, agricultural fields, and even near human settlements. The peacock is revered in Indian mythology—often depicted with deities like Lord Krishna and Saraswati, and featured in traditional art and architecture.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The significance of the Indian Peacock is further elevated by its status as the <strong>National Bird of India</strong>, a title it earned in 1963 due to its rich cultural, religious, and ecological symbolism. Unlike most wild birds, peacocks enjoy protection under Indian law, and harming or hunting them is a punishable offense. While they are not considered endangered, habitat degradation and pesticide use in agricultural zones pose long-term risks. Nonetheless, the Indian Peacock continues to enchant generations with its beauty and grace.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-4">Habitat & State-Wise Presence</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Indian Peacock is native to the Indian subcontinent and is found in almost every Indian state, from the Himalayan foothills to the southern plains. Its adaptability to various habitats—from dense forests and dry scrublands to cultivated farmlands—makes it one of the most widely distributed birds in India. The bird prefers open woodlands interspersed with bushes and water sources. States like Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu have thriving populations. In rural India, peacocks are often seen foraging in farmlands and temple courtyards, where they are rarely disturbed by humans.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-lg mt-4">
        <li><strong>Rajasthan:</strong> Frequently seen in deserts and rural fields</li>
        <li><strong>Gujarat & Maharashtra:</strong> Found near water bodies and hilly terrain</li>
        <li><strong>Himachal Pradesh & Uttarakhand:</strong> Seen in lower Himalayan regions</li>
        <li><strong>South India (Tamil Nadu, Karnataka):</strong> Common in temple gardens and forests</li>
        <li><strong>West Bengal & Odisha:</strong> Found in moist deciduous forests</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Indian Peacock has also been introduced to other parts of the world due to its popularity, including Sri Lanka, Myanmar, and even distant countries like the U.S., Australia, and South Africa. However, in its homeland, the bird's presence is deeply rooted in cultural heritage and rural ecosystems. Though thriving, their nesting and chick-rearing are highly dependent on undisturbed, safe environments—making habitat conservation essential.

    <!-- Conservation and Cultural Importance -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-md">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-blue-900 mb-4">Conservation & Cultural Significance</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Though not endangered, the Indian Peacock is listed under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, which grants it the highest level of legal protection in India. This measure was taken to prevent illegal hunting and trading of its feathers, which are highly valued in decoration and rituals. Government orders prohibit the sale of peacock feathers, although naturally shed feathers can be collected and used. Protected forest reserves and eco-tourism zones have helped sustain peacock populations in recent years.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Peacocks are immensely revered in Indian culture. Lord Krishna is almost always depicted with a peacock feather in his crown, symbolizing beauty, joy, and divinity. In South India, the bird is associated with Lord Murugan, the god of war, who rides a peacock named Paravani. The feathers are used in religious ceremonies, classical dances, and art. Even in contemporary festivals and paintings, peacocks symbolize auspiciousness and protection from evil spirits.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Conservationists continue to emphasize awareness, habitat preservation, and sustainable tourism to protect peacocks from urban encroachment and agricultural pollution. Local communities in many states protect peacocks out of tradition and belief, creating a natural shield for the species. This harmonious relationship between humans and the peacock showcases India's unique model of cultural conservation.

        The Indian Peacock is much more than a bird—it is a living emblem of India's biodiversity, spiritual traditions, and aesthetic sensibilities. As it struts across fields and forests with unmatched elegance, the peacock reminds us of the wonders of nature and the importance of coexistence.
