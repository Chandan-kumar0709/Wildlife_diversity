      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Nilgiri Tahr (<em>Nilgiritragus hylocrius</em>) is an endangered species of mountain goat native to the Western Ghats of southern India. These agile and sure-footed animals are symbolic of the high-altitude shola grassland ecosystem, particularly in the states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu.
        <br><br>
        With its short, curved horns, sturdy frame, and shaggy brown to greyish coat, the Nilgiri Tahr is uniquely adapted to the steep cliffs and rocky outcrops of its native range. Once widespread, its numbers have drastically declined due to habitat loss and hunting. Conservation efforts are now crucial for the survival of this majestic species.

    <!-- Classification and Habitat -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">Classification and Habitat</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Nilgiri Tahr belongs to the family Bovidae and is classified as follows:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> Animalia</li>
          <li><strong>Phylum:</strong> Chordata</li>
          <li><strong>Class:</strong> Mammalia</li>
          <li><strong>Order:</strong> Artiodactyla</li>
          <li><strong>Family:</strong> Bovidae</li>
          <li><strong>Genus:</strong> Nilgiritragus</li>
          <li><strong>Species:</strong> N. hylocrius</li>
        </ul>
        Nilgiri Tahrs are found at altitudes of 1,200 to 2,600 meters in the montane grasslands and forest edges. These habitats, known as "shola forests," are unique to the Western Ghats and support high biodiversity. The species shows a preference for open, steep grassy slopes.

            The Indian Nilgiri Tahr is the state animal of Tamil Nadu and is known for its rugged strength and graceful climbing abilities. Males are larger and darker in color, with a distinct silver saddle on their back, while females are smaller and lighter in tone.
            <br><br>
            These tahrs are social animals and usually move in herds of 10–15. Their breeding season occurs between June and August, and a single kid is born after a gestation period of 180 days. Nilgiri Tahrs feed mainly on grasses, herbs, and low shrubs available in their habitat.
            <br><br>
            Due to their restricted range and habitat specificity, they are highly vulnerable to human activities like encroachment and tourism pressure.

      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Nilgiri Tahr is endemic to the Western Ghats and is mainly found in:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li>Eravikulam National Park (Kerala)</li>
          <li>Grass Hills National Park (Tamil Nadu)</li>
          <li>Mukurthi National Park (Tamil Nadu)</li>
          <li>Silent Valley and Kalakad Mundanthurai regions</li>
        </ul>
        Their estimated population is around 3,000 individuals. Long-term protection measures in places like Eravikulam have shown considerable success, with the park becoming a flagship site for Nilgiri Tahr recovery.

        The Nilgiri Tahr is classified as <strong>Endangered</strong> by the IUCN. It is also protected under Schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. Key threats to its survival include:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li>Habitat fragmentation from plantations and infrastructure</li>
          <li>Invasive species like wattles and eupatorium crowding out native grass</li>
          <li>Poaching and accidental deaths</li>
          <li>Tourism-related disturbances in protected zones</li>
        </ul>
        Conservation strategies include:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li>Strict habitat protection and patrolling in national parks</li>
          <li>Invasive plant removal and restoration of native grasslands</li>
          <li>Monitoring populations through scientific surveys</li>
          <li>Community awareness and eco-tourism regulations</li>
