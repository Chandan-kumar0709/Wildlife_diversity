      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Lion-tailed Macaque (<em>Macaca silenus</em>), also known as the wanderoo, is a rare and endangered primate species found exclusively in the Western Ghats of India. It gets its name from its distinctive tail, which resembles that of a lion, tufted at the end. The Lion-tailed Macaque is one of the most threatened and charismatic primates in India, known for its intelligent eyes, expressive face, and unique mane of silvery-white hair surrounding its head, contrasting its jet-black fur.
        <br><br>
        This primate is highly arboreal and spends most of its time in the upper canopy of rainforests, rarely coming down to the ground. It lives in small, tightly bonded groups and shows a high degree of social structure. Despite its small size compared to other macaques, it is bold and fiercely territorial. Unfortunately, due to habitat loss, fragmentation, and hunting, its population has drastically declined in the past few decades, placing it among the most endangered primates in the world.

    <!-- Classification and Habitat -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">Classification and Habitat</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Lion-tailed Macaque belongs to the family Cercopithecidae and is scientifically classified as:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> Animalia</li>
          <li><strong>Phylum:</strong> Chordata</li>
          <li><strong>Class:</strong> Mammalia</li>
          <li><strong>Order:</strong> Primates</li>
          <li><strong>Family:</strong> Cercopithecidae</li>
          <li><strong>Genus:</strong> Macaca</li>
          <li><strong>Species:</strong> M. silenus</li>
        </ul>
        Their habitat is restricted to the tropical rainforests of the Western Ghats, primarily in states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Karnataka. These regions provide the dense canopy and rich biodiversity necessary for their survival. The macaque prefers undisturbed, evergreen forests and avoids plantations or fragmented patches, which increases their vulnerability as forest cover shrinks due to human activities like logging and agricultural expansion.

            The Lion-tailed Macaque is a medium-sized monkey with a unique appearance. It has a black body, a silvery-white mane, and a face with a human-like expression. Its most iconic feature is the lion-like tail with a black tuft at the end, from which it derives its name. Adult males are larger than females and typically dominate social groups. These primates are diurnal and forage in the morning and late afternoon, feeding on fruits, seeds, flowers, insects, and small vertebrates.
            <br><br>
            What makes the Lion-tailed Macaque particularly fascinating is its intelligence and problem-solving ability. It is known to use tools and display sophisticated communication through calls, gestures, and facial expressions. These macaques have complex social hierarchies and live in groups led by dominant males, with strong bonds among females. Mating rituals, child-rearing behaviors, and grooming patterns reflect deep social instincts.

    <!-- State-wise Presence in India -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">Presence in India</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Lion-tailed Macaque is exclusively found in India, within the dense forests of the Western Ghats. The following states report its presence:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Kerala:</strong> Silent Valley National Park, Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary</li>
          <li><strong>Tamil Nadu:</strong> Anamalai Tiger Reserve, Kalakkad Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve</li>
          <li><strong>Karnataka:</strong> Kudremukh National Park, Brahmagiri Hills</li>
        </ul>
        Though they were once widespread across the Western Ghats, their current distribution is highly fragmented. Many groups are isolated due to road construction, hydroelectric projects, and deforestation. This isolation leads to inbreeding, limited gene flow, and fewer mating opportunities, further endangering the population.

    <!-- Threats and Conservation -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">Threats and Conservation</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Lion-tailed Macaque faces several threats, pushing it to the brink of extinction. The primary threat is habitat loss due to logging, encroachment, and plantation agriculture, especially tea and coffee. Their shy nature and strong preference for undisturbed forest make them especially sensitive to human activities.
        <br><br>
        Conservation strategies include:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li>Establishing protected corridors between fragmented forests</li>
          <li>Strengthening laws against deforestation and encroachment</li>
          <li>Monitoring macaque populations through regular surveys</li>
          <li>Educating local communities about the importance of the species</li>
          <li>Conducting rehabilitation and breeding programs in conservation parks</li>
        </ul>
        Organizations such as the Wildlife Trust of India and government forest departments have been actively involved in conserving the species. Ecotourism initiatives have also helped raise awareness while providing local income alternatives that reduce forest pressure.

    <!-- Conclusion -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-green-800 mb-4">Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Indian Lion-tailed Macaque is not just a rare primate but a symbol of the fragile biodiversity of India’s Western Ghats. With their charismatic presence and social complexity, they serve as ambassadors of India’s vanishing rainforests. Protecting them means protecting an entire ecosystem and ensuring the balance of forest life. It is our responsibility to work together—scientists, governments, communities, and individuals—to save this iconic species from extinction. Let us act now before the silent canopy loses its lion-tailed guardian forever.
