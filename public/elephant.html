            The Indian elephant is a subspecies of the Asian Elephant, scientifically known as <strong>Elephas maximus indicus</strong>. Native to the Indian subcontinent, this magnificent mammal plays an essential ecological role by dispersing seeds and maintaining forest biodiversity.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 text-lg">
            These elephants are typically found in herds, led by a matriarch. They are highly social, intelligent, and capable of forming strong emotional bonds with other elephants. Unlike African elephants, only a few Indian male elephants have tusks, while females never do.

      <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Asiatic elephants prefer forested habitats including grasslands, tropical moist forests, and dry deciduous forests. Their diet is herbivorous, consisting of grasses, fruits, roots, bark, and crops, which sometimes brings them into conflict with humans. As migratory animals, they follow ancient corridors to travel long distances in search of food and water.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In India, the Indian Elephant is regarded as culturally sacred and is often associated with Lord Ganesha in Hindu mythology. Despite the respect they receive, they are endangered due to habitat loss, railway accidents, human-elephant conflict, and poaching for ivory.
