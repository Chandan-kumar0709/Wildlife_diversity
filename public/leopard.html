      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The leopard, a master of stealth and adaptability, is one of the most widespread big cats on Earth. Known for its spotted coat and elusive behavior, the leopard thrives in a wide range of habitats — from savannas to forests and even cold mountainous regions. In India, several species of leopards can be found, including the iconic Snow Leopard.

      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg">
        <li><strong>Indian Leopard (Panthera pardus fusca):</strong> Found in most forested regions, including the Western Ghats, Central India, and the Himalayas’ foothills.</li>
        <li><strong>Snow Leopard (Panthera uncia):</strong> Native to the higher Himalayas, especially Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh.</li>

      <div class="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">

            The <strong>Snow Leopard</strong>, often called the “ghost of the mountains,” is a symbol of mystery and resilience. These elusive big cats inhabit the harsh, cold, high-altitude regions of the Himalayas, typically between 3,000 and 5,500 meters above sea level. Their thick smoky-grey fur, with black rosettes, blends perfectly with the rocky terrain, making them almost invisible in their natural environment.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Adapted to cold climates, Snow Leopards have large nasal cavities to warm the air they breathe, powerful hind legs for leaping across cliffs, and long tails for balance and warmth. Unlike other big cats, they do not roar but communicate through yowls and growls.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Snow Leopards are solitary and primarily prey on Himalayan blue sheep (bharal), ibex, marmots, and domestic livestock. Their stealth and camouflage allow them to get within striking distance of their prey, often executing an ambush attack.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Unfortunately, these majestic cats face threats from habitat degradation, climate change, poaching, and retaliatory killings due to livestock predation. As a result, they are classified as <strong>“Vulnerable”</strong> by the IUCN.
