      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Indian Blackbuck (*Antilope cervicapra*), also known as the Indian antelope, is one of the most graceful and fastest terrestrial animals in the Indian subcontinent. With its elegant spiraled horns and sleek body, it represents a symbol of agility and beauty in the wild. The male is known for its striking dark brown to black upper parts contrasting with white underparts, while the female is usually fawn-colored and lacks horns.
        <br><br>
        Found primarily in grasslands and semi-arid regions, Blackbucks are iconic to the Indian savannas. They are herbivores and exhibit strong group behavior, forming herds led by dominant males. Once widespread, their numbers dwindled due to hunting and habitat loss. Today, conservation programs are gradually reviving their populations.

    <!-- Classification and Habitat -->
    <section class="bg-white p-6 rounded-xl shadow-lg fade-up">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-800 mb-4">Classification and Habitat</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Blackbucks belong to the Bovidae family and are scientifically classified as:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li><strong>Kingdom:</strong> Animalia</li>
          <li><strong>Phylum:</strong> Chordata</li>
          <li><strong>Class:</strong> Mammalia</li>
          <li><strong>Order:</strong> Artiodactyla</li>
          <li><strong>Family:</strong> Bovidae</li>
          <li><strong>Genus:</strong> Antilope</li>
          <li><strong>Species:</strong> A. cervicapra</li>
        </ul>
        Blackbucks thrive in open plains and grasslands, preferring areas with minimal forest cover. They are most active during cooler parts of the day, grazing on grasses, cereals, and pods. Their speed and agility help them evade predators like wolves and stray dogs.

            The Indian Blackbuck is native to the Indian subcontinent and is mainly found in India and parts of Nepal and Pakistan. Males have beautiful spiraled horns that can reach up to 70 cm in length and exhibit a seasonal darkening of their coat.
            <br><br>
            Blackbucks are known for their high-speed gallops and twisting jumps, especially during the rutting season. Males establish territories and engage in sparring duels using their horns to attract females. The mating season generally falls between March and May.
            <br><br>
            They are diurnal and can often be seen grazing in herds of 15 to 50 individuals. Females give birth to one fawn after a gestation period of about 6 months, and the young ones are highly alert and able to stand shortly after birth.

      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-yellow-800 mb-4">Presence in India</h2>
      <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        The Indian Blackbuck is predominantly found in:
        <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mt-4 text-lg space-y-1">
          <li>Gujarat – Velavadar Blackbuck National Park</li>
          <li>Rajasthan – Tal Chhapar Sanctuary</li>
          <li>Punjab and Haryana grasslands</li>
          <li>Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu</li>
        </ul>
        Conservation efforts have helped reintroduce Blackbucks into protected zones. Their population has increased notably in community-led conservation areas such as Bishnoi villages in Rajasthan, where they are revered and protected by local communities.
